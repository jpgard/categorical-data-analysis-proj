Notes about the subject analysis

12/8/17
I am really having a hard time getting the data into a format that could use a test for independence. I think that more data needs to be pulled. Instead of just getting the school aggregated counts, I think we need the data by student. Right now if we see that 100 people got 3's in Biology, we do not know how to split up those 3's across the Chemistry grade distribution. Did all 100 people also get 3's in Chemistry? Having by student data will allow us to correctly classify a student across both subjects.

I pulled a new dataset called students_grades_total.csv from pg admin using the students_final_grades SQL query off github. The query produces 842,624 rows. However, everytime I try to save it to a csv, pg Admin crashes. LOL. That was also not the right query. Need to work on getting the data before we can do anything.
