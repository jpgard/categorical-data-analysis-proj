Notes about the school analysis

12/8/17
I having a really hard time treating the grade values as ordinal. Agresti p. 195 talks about an approach to test for conditional independence between K strata using the CMH test statistic. However, the CMH test statistic is only defined for 2 x 2 x K tables. With three schools and 5 grades we would have a 3 x 5 x K table. There is a generalized CMH statistic that he uses. I do not understand how to calculate this test statistic. If we can figure out the generalized CMH test, we can set K = 1 and do a subject by subject analysis or set K = number of courses and account for all grades for schools.
--> An email was sent to Terhorst about my inability to understand this generalized test statistic.

I went on with the analysis not treating the grade values as ordinal. Most of the 0's in the counts are in the 1 and 2 grade value marks. This shows a warning that the chi square test for independence might not be exact. I ran a test for independence for the three schools over each subject. All p-values were 0. There is no evidence that of an association between school and the grade distribution. All the schools are the same. I also ran the analysis excluding the 1 and 2 grade values, it made no difference. While uninteresting, it shows that the schools are handing out grades in the same way.
--> Possible add more schools? The analysis is very quick.

Moved on to try and fit a mixed effect model. The response variable is if the student passed (grade value 4 or 5) coded as 1 or if they failed (grade value 1-3) coded as 0. There is some concern because there are barely any 1 and 2's. So even by including 3, the failed group is much smaller than the pass group. First tried to fit a mixed effect model with school being the random intercept. It takes a really long time. Could we run this on a server?

* Idea: Do we have any school information? Private or Public? Size? % of students with certain reading level? To fit a hierarchical model we would need a second-level model that is all about the schools. I think this is a very natural place to use this type of model if we have this information. Check lecture 10 page 11 for notes.
